# node-sftp-server - Changes by Andreas

This is not intended to be final or anthing like that, but as I managed to use filezilla I figured I should share.
In filezilla you need to set the initfolder in order for it to work.
Part of the changes are found in other forks, some are made by me.

I will most likely not put in any more time into this code, the only reason for putting it out there is if someone have the same need that I had.. Also someone should try to merge all the fixes as the projekt seem to be pretty dead.
